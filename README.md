# GroceryTracking

Name: Matthew Cochrane

This is my submission for my Module Eight Journal in CS-210 at SNHU.

This program takes a text file of an assortment of grocery items and will count how many of each grocery item there are and output that to the user, or it will take a string input for an item and output how many of that specific item there are. In my implementation of this, I felt that I executed the counting functionality pretty well. Each new grocery item scanned creates a dictionary for that item and each time that same item is scanned it updates the value by adding one. If an improvement is to be made it would be to add more functionality and customizability such as categorizing groceries and outputting graphs based on those categories. The most challenging part of writing this is also the part I ended up doing pretty well on, which is how I count the groceries. I have stackoverflow to thank for that.
